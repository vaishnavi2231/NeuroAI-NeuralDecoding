# 🧠 Week 2 — Brain Regions and Their Functions  

**Date:** October 2025  
**Topic:** Overview of Human Nervous System & Functional Brain Anatomy  

---

## 🧩 Introduction  

The **human nervous system** is the body’s main communication network, enabling sensation, movement, thought, and emotion.  
It is divided into two primary components:  

1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**  
2. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**  

---

## 🔹 Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)  
 
The PNS connects the CNS to limbs and organs. It is subdivided into:  

- **Somatic Nervous System:**  
  Controls voluntary movement of skeletal muscles, skin, and sensory organs.  

- **Autonomic Nervous System:**  
  Regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion.  
  It manages visceral activities through specialized neurons.  

---

## 🔸 Central Nervous System (CNS)  

The CNS comprises the **brain** and **spinal cord**.  

- **Spinal Cord:**  
  Acts as the main communication pathway, conveying **motor control signals** from the brain to muscles and **sensory feedback** from muscles back to the brain.  

---

## 🧠 Brain Regions  

The brain can be broadly viewed in **three hierarchical layers**, each supporting distinct functions.

---

### 🧱 Lower Layer  
**Components:** Midbrain, Medulla, and Pons  

- **Midbrain**  
  - **Tectum:** Controls eye movements and visual/auditory reflexes.  
  - **Tegmentum:** Modulates muscle reflexes, pain perception, and breathing.  

- **Medulla & Pons**  
  Handle **basic regulatory functions** — breathing, muscle tone, blood pressure, sleep, and arousal.  

---

### ⚙️ Middle Layer  
**Components:** Cerebellum and Thalamus  

- **Cerebellum (“Little Brain”):**  
  Coordinates movement, balance, and motor precision.  

- **Thalamus:**  
  Serves as the **relay station**, conveying information from sensory organs to the **neocortex**.  

---

### 🧬 Upper Layer  
**Component:** Neocortex  

The **neocortex** sits at the top of the brain and is composed of approximately:  
- **30 billion neurons**,  
- Each forming around **10,000 synapses**,  
- Arranged in **six layers**, making roughly **300 trillion connections**.  

Each cortical region is specialized for a particular function:  

| Cortical Area | Primary Function |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Occipital Lobe** | Visual processing |
| **Parietal Lobe** | Spatial reasoning & motion processing |
| **Temporal Lobe** | Visual and auditory recognition |
| **Frontal Lobe** | Planning, decision-making & higher cognition |

Additional key structures include:  

- **Basal Ganglia:** Motor control and action selection  
- **Amygdala:** Emotional regulation  
- **Hippocampus:** Memory formation and learning  

The cortex operates as a **hierarchically organized network** of sensory and motor regions —  
inputs arrive mainly in **middle cortical layers**, while outputs are generated from **upper and lower layers**.

## 🧾 Summary  

- The **CNS** integrates information and directs responses, while the **PNS** connects the body to the CNS.  
- The **lower brain regions** manage vital reflexes and regulation.  
- The **middle layer** integrates motor coordination and sensory relay.  
- The **upper neocortex** enables cognition, planning, memory, and learning.  

Together, these regions form the intricate system that allows humans to **perceive, act, and think** — foundational knowledge for understanding **Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI)**.
